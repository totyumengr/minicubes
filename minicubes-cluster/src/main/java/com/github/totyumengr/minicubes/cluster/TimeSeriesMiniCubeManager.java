 * It's design as a prophet in {@link MiniCube Cube World} that known all of things about {@link MiniCube MiniCubes}.
 * 
 * <p>One {@link MiniCube} live in one JVM and the converse is the same, simply say: one-2-one relationship.
 * Id of cube will be assigned when it came into {@link TimeSeriesMiniCubeManager}, the format is: {cube date}::{cube name}@{node name}.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>cube date: time dimension member name, for example 20140201, 201402, 2014Q1, 2014H1, 2014. <code>?</code> if not be assigned yet.
 *   <li>cube name: In general it's contains dimension name and indicator name. <code>cluster name </code> if not assign.
 *   <li>node name: JVM name, {@link com.hazelcast.core.Member Hazelcast member} in our default implementation
 * 
 * <p>Unified dimension is important in analysis scene, so one cube cluster has <b>only one</b> dimension group.
 * 
 * <p>What means time-series cube? Shard by date time.
